# ActivityJournalApp
My first API project and my first go at React JS created as a lab in the course [Application development for the internet at ume√• university](https://www.umu.se/utbildning/kurser/applikationsutveckling-for-internet/). It uses .NET core, SQL, and Entity Framework in the backend and React JS with Tailwind CSS in the front end. 

It is a habit tracking app where users can create logs of activities that they do.
